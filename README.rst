A cross-platform desktop file organizer

Introduction
============

Descratter is a cross-platform desktop application for organizing, tagging, and searching files
within a file system on a hard drsk. Descatter attempts to reduce the amount of 'managing' a user 
does with files and folders but maintain a consistent organization for quickly 
browsing and searching files of any typoe. Descatter is designed to work with
the native file system of the operating system. Descatter is not a version control system (there is 
no need to re-invent wheel, there are plenty of great version control systems available). The 
original intended audience for Descatter was scientists to help them better manage data files
from multiple sources for multiple experiments and projects.
