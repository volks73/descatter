A cross-platform desktop application for renaming and organizing files.

Introduction
============

Descratter is a cross-platform desktop application for organizing and renaming files within a file system on a hard disk.
The purpose of the application is to make moving and renaming files to follow a given folder heiarchy easier.
Organization of files and folders often occur organically over time as a user creates and deletes files and folders.
This organic evolution of organizating files and folders often requires bulk, or batch, renaming and moving of files and folders.
Descratter attempts to help with the bulk, or batch, renaming actions and aid users in adhering to a specific naming and folder convention. 

A folder hiearchy, or structure, is defined in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) file that governs the naming, moving, and copying of the files during bulk operation.
The XML file also acts as documentation to structure of the folder organization so the user and others can find files in the future.
