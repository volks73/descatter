Descratter is a cross-platform desktop application for organizing, cataloging, and
tagging files. Descatter attempts to reduce the amount of 'managing' a user does
with files and folders but maintain a consistent organization for quickly 
organizing, browsing, and searching of any type of file. Descatter is designed to work with
the native file system of the operating system and should not be considered a replacement
for a file manager or explorer. Also, Descatter is not a version control system (there is 
no need to re-invent wheel, there are plenty of great version control systems available). The 
original intended audience for Descatter was scientists to help them better manage data files
from multiple sources for multiple experiments and projects.
